# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game is designed for two players to play on a command-line interface. The game board is displayed in the console, and players take turns to mark their chosen positions until there's a winner or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Board display in the console
- Win checking and draw detection
- Replay functionality

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Files

- `lib.py`: Contains functions to handle game logic such as displaying the board, checking for wins, placing markers, and managing game states.
- `main.py`: The main script that sets up and runs the game, handling player input, switching turns, and determining the game outcome.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository.

## Usage

To start the game, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
